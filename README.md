# biopython_quast_output
Biopython code to run in command line, output similar to a QUAST report but less complete summary

The purpose of this program is to provide the following outputs from a fasta file: N50 value, total number of contigs, total length of contigs, and largest contig length
This file is designed to be run in the terminal command line using $ python3 myquast.py <fasta_file.fa> 
##In this program the fasta file is named "contigs.fa"
##Any fasta file format will work (ie. files ending in .fasta or .fa)
